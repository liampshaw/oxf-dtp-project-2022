# DTP project 2022

Data files for DTP Bioinformatics hackathon project, December 2022.  

Data are taken from [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/)

Within `data` directory:

* `CARD_Escherichia_coli_AMR_gene_prevalence.tsv` - prevalence information on AMR genes within *Escherichia coli*
* `CARD_Escherichia_coli_nucleotide_AMR_genes.fasta` - nucleotide fasta file of AMR genes (only those within *Escherichia coli*)
* TO BE ADDED: list of R-M targets within *Escherichia coli*.

For the purposes of this project I have selected out only resistance genes that have been detected by a [protein homolog model](https://card.mcmaster.ca/ontology/40292): "Protein Homolog Models apply to all genes that confer resistance through their presence in an organism, such as the presence of a beta-lactamase gene on a plasmid."
